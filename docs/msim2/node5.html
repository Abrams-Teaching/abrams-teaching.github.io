Introductory Remarks</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this course, we are concerned with systems of many particles.  Such
a system models a chunk of matter, and the particles are its
constituents.  <EM>Statistical mechanics</EM> allows us predict the
macroscopic properties and behavior of matter when conceptualized as
collections of many (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img67.png"
 ALT="$\sim$"></SPAN>&nbsp;10<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img68.png"
 ALT="$^{23}$"></SPAN>) particles, and it is the
central theme of this course.  As we will see, the formalism of
statistical mechanics allows straightforward analytical treatment of
only a few simple systems.  The primary motivation behind molecular
simulation is to apply the framework of statistical mechanics in the
prediction of macroscopic behavior for relatively &ldquo;complicated&rdquo;
systems.  The two major branches of molecular simulation we will
consider are (1) Monte Carlo (MC) and (2) molecular dynamics (MD).

<P>
Statistical mechanics is a broad subject, and we will restrict
ourselves in this course to stat mech at the introductory level.  The
lessons of elementary stat mech will be reinforced time and time again
throughout the course as we explore aspects of molecular simulation
techniques.  Stat mech is not normally taught to engineering students
outside a general course on physical chemistry.  (Undergraduates in
physics or chemistry might get a one or two course series on
statistical mechanics.)

<P>
A second component of this course is programming.  Most engineering
students take a programming course, so some exposure to computer programming
is expected as a prerequisite.  It will be necessary to discuss
certain simulation algorithms using &ldquo;pseudo-code&rdquo; examples, or even
examples written in C or FORTRAN or Python.  The level of code presented in this
course will generally be sufficiently basic such that novices can
understand it line by line.  For example, see if you can predict what
the following C program does:

<P>
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;100;i++) printf("Hello, I am number %i\n",i);
}
</PRE>

<P>
Maybe you'd like it better in Python:

<P>
<PRE>
for i in range(100):
    print('Hello, I am number',i)
</PRE>

<P>
If it looks somewhat mysterious to you, don't worry.  Part of this
course will be explaining how code works.  By the end of the course,
you would be able to <EM>write</EM> the above program had I told you to write a program to output the numbers 0 - 99.  It must be emphasized at this point that I do not intend to turn
you all into expert coders (though there are worse things to aim for).  This is a survey course from which I hope
you gain an accurate picture of the field of molecular simulation from
which you can begin your own exploration.  In order to achieve this
goal, it is necessary to do some <EM>minor</EM> work with actual code.

<P>
A closely related aspect of this component is the practical matter of
how one <EM>works</EM> with simulation code.  My preference, and
therefore the manner in which I teach the course, is to use a
command-line environment, as opposed to a graphical user environment.  It should be emphasized
that the concepts and ideas that form the backbone of this course are
not operating system-specific.  However, the <EM>implementation</EM> of
those ideas and concepts, as I hope you will see, is straightforward
once you know how to compile and run simple programs at the command-line.  Again, this will be at a basic level; this is not a
programming course.  All of the production MD codes we consider later in the course are <EM>exclusively</EM> used in a command-line environment.  For writing and editing code, I recommend VSCode. 

<P>
Much of this course is based on the book <I>Understanding Molecular
Simulation</I> by Daan Frenkel and Berend Smit,&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node82.html#Frenkel+Smit2002">1</A>]
two chemical engineers from Amsterdam. There are several other books which I have used
on occasion, the most useful of which was <EM>Computer Simulation of Liquids</EM> by Allen
and Tildesly.&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node82.html#Allen+Tildesley1987">2</A>].
