<P>
Your grade in this course will be based on a small project, which you
will hand in as a report of a maximum of 10 pages, and about which you
will make a <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img51.png"
 ALT="$\sim$">&nbsp;10 minute presentation during the final week of the
term.  

<P>
The goal of this project is to convince yourself that you have gained
a working understanding of some aspect of molecular simulation that
is of interest to you.  For this reason, you are given a large amount
of freedom in choosing your topic.  Here you'll find a compiled list of 
suggested project exercises, also found interspersed throughout
the rest of the website.

<P>
You'll also see the schedule.  Sign-up is first-come, first-served.
Please send me an email at
<A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="mailto:cfa22@drexel.edu">cfa2@drexel.edu</A>
with your
project title and your top three time-slot choices as soon as
possible.  There are 13 available slots as of May 14, 2004; as there
are 10 of you officially giving presentations, this should be
adequate.
