Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
This introduction pertains to a course I taught at the graduate level at Drexel in the 2003-2004 academic year.

<P>
<B>Course Objectives</B>

<P>
The objective of this course is to provide graduate students with a
basic understanding of molecular simulation.  The level of
understanding we will target involves both the skills to critique
current molecular simulation research in the students' respective
fields and to develop simple simulation programs that may 
contribute to students' original research.

<P>
<B>Course Outline</B>

<LI>Statistical Mechanics

<LI>Computing under GNU/Linux

<LI>Monte Carlo Simulation (MC)

<P>
<B>Prerequisites</B>

<P>
Calculus and differential equations through the undergraduate level.
Undergraduate physical chemistry (rudimentary quantum and statistical
mechanics).  Some knowledge of programming will be helpful.  Access to
either a Windows or Linux PC is required.

<P>
<B>Course Policies</B>

<P>
Recommended homework exercises will be suggested.  The grade is based
on a final project of the student's choice.  A description of the
project assignment appears in Sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node57.html#sec:project">8</A>.  Participants
will be granted user accounts on the instructor's Linux cluster, <TT>syrinx.chemeng.drexel.edu</TT>.

<P>
<B>Introductory Remarks</B>

<P>
In this course, we are concerned with systems of many particles.  Such
a system models a chunk of matter, and the particles are its
contituents.  <EM>Statistical mechanics</EM> allows us predict the
macroscopic properties and behavior of matter when conceptualized as
collections of many (<IMG

 SRC="img51.png"
 ALT="$\sim$">&nbsp;10<IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img52.png"
 ALT="$^{23}$">) particles, and it is the
central theme of this course.  As we will see, the formalism of
statistical mechanics allows straightforward analytical treatment of
only a few simple systems.  The primary motivation behind molecular
simulation is to apply the framework of statistical mechanics in the
prediction of macroscopic behavior for relatively ``complicated''
systems.  The two major branches of molecular simulation we will
consider are (1) Monte Carlo and (2) molecular dynamics.

<P>
Statistical mechanics is a broad subject, and we will restrict
ourselves in this course to stat mech at the introductory level.  The
lessons of elementary stat mech will be reinforced time and time again
throughout the course as we explore aspects of molecular simulation
techniques.  Stat mech is not normally taught to engineering students
outside a general course on physical chemistry.  (Undergraduates in
physics or chemistry might get a one or two course series on
statistical mechanics.)

<P>
A second component of this course is programming.  Most engineering
students take a programming course (though this is not true for our
unfortunate tDEC students), so some exposure to computer programming
is expected as a prerequisite.  It will be necessary to discuss
certain simulation algorithms using ``pseudo-code'' examples, or even
examples written in C or FORTRAN.  The level of code presented in this
course will generally be sufficiently basic such that novices can
understand it line by line.  For example, see if you can predict what
the following C program does:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () {
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;100;i++) printf(``Hello, I am number %i\n'',i);
}
</PRE>
If it looks somewhat mysterious to you, don't worry.  Part of this
course will be explaining how code works.  By the end of the course,
you would be able to <EM>write</EM> the above program (perhaps in
FORTRAN) had I told you to write a program to output the numbers 0 -
99.  It must be emphasized at this point that I do not intend to turn
you all into expert coders.  This is a survey course from which I hope
you gain an accurate picture of the field of molecular simulation from
which you can begin your own exploration.  In order to achieve this
goal, it is necessary to do some <EM>minor</EM> work with actual code.

<P>
A closely related aspect of this component is the practical matter of
how one <EM>works</EM> with simulation code.  My preference, and
therefore the manner in which I teach the course, is to use a
Unix-like environment, as opposed to Windows.  It should be emphasized
that the concepts and ideas that form the backbone of this course are
not operating system-specific.  However, the <EM>implementation</EM> of
those ideas and concepts, as I hope you will see, is straightforward
once you know how to write, compile, and run simple programs at a Unix
prompt.  Again, this will be at a basic level; this is not a
programming course.

<P>
Much of this course is based on the book <I>Understanding Molecular
Simulation</I> by Daan Frenkel and Berend Smit,&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node63.html#Frenkel+Smit2002">1</A>]
two chemical engineers from Amsterdam.  The book's website,
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://molsim.chem.uva.nl/frenkel_smit/">http://molsim.chem.uva.nl/frenkel_smit/</A>, is an excellent resource for
FORTRAN source code.  There are several other books which I have used
on occasion,&nbsp;[<A

 HREF="node63.html#Rapaport1995">3</A>,<A
 HREF="node63.html#Leach2001">4</A>] the
most useful of which was <EM>Computer Simulation of Liquids</EM> by Allen
and Tildesly.&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node63.html#Allen+Tildesley1987">2</A>].
