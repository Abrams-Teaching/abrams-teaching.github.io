#!/usr/bin/gnuplot
#
# a gnuplot script that produces Fig. 4.3 in Frenkel + Smit. 
# Save this and make it an executable:
#
# > chmod 744 gp43
# then execute as
# > ./gp43
#
# It will produce a postscript file fig4.3.eps.  If you have
# ImageMagick installed under cygwin or windows, you can look 
# at it or convert it to another image format.
# With acrobat, you can view it as well.
#
# Note that it plots from a data file called "1.tmp".  The
# file 1.out has ~600000 lines, most of which are unnecessary
# for generating this figure.  So, I "chopped off" the first 3000
# lines and put them in "1.tmp" using
#
# > head -1000 1.out > 1.tmp
#
